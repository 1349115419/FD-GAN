In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end algorithm FD-GAN for image dehazing. Moreover, we develop a novel Fusion-discriminator which can integrate the frequency information as additional priors and constraints into the dehazing network. Our method can generate more visually pleasing dehazed results with less color distortion. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic datasets and real-world hazy images.
